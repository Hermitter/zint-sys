# zint-sys

This crate generates unsafe Rust bindings, through [rust-bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen), for using the [Zint Barcode library](https://www.zint.org.uk/). Note that Zint is not packaged in this crate and is expected to be [installed](https://www.zint.org.uk/manual/chapter/2).

# Usage
> Be sure to review Zint's [Legal Information](https://www.zint.org.uk/manual/chapter/7)

There're no examples currently provided, however, you can use the test in [lib.rs](./src/lib.rs) as a reference for using [Zint's API](https://www.zint.org.uk/manual/chapter/5) in Rust.
